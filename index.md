### Project I : A Middle Layer Based Scalable Learned Index Scheme
1. Integrated the data access patterns into the neural network during the training phase, which can improve the prediction accuracy of the model for hotspot data.
2. Borrowed the idea of LSM tree, i.e., delay update mechanism, which greatly improved the data writing speed.
3. Proposed a middle layer based mechanism for model decoupling in the index update phase, thus easing the problem of index updating cost.
4. Conducted extensive experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our model is better than the state-of-the-art methods.

### Project II : An Efficient Framework for Social-Based Time-Aware Spatial Keyword Query
1. Formulated the problem of Social-based Time-aware Spatial Keyword Query (STSKQ), which takes geo-spatial score, keywords similarity, visiting time score, and social relationship effect into consideration.
2. Proposed a hybrid index structure, i.e., NETR-tree that exploits network embedding and efficient pruning strategies to tackle STSKQ.
3. Conducted experiments and showed our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for processing STSKQ on real-world datasets.
